## Quick Troubleshooting

### AI Not Working?
1. Check `.env` file has API key
2. Check browser console
3. Falls back to demo mode (it's okay!)

### Submission Failed?
1. Valid JSON required
2. All fields filled
3. Check console for errors

### Slow Response?
1. Gemini free tier limits
2. Use demo mode as backup
3. Mock responses work great!

## Emergency Backup Plan

If AI fails completely:

1. ✅ **Demo mode works** - pre-built responses
2. ✅ **Show code** - explain the logic
3. ✅ **Export workflows** - participants can test later
4. ✅ **Manual grading** - you review submissions

**Everything still works!**
