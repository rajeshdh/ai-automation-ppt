  // Slide 0: Live Workflow Simulation
  "This animation demonstrates how automation workflows operate in real-time. Data flows through four key stages: a trigger initiates the process, a filter checks conditions, an AI agent processes the information, and finally an action executes the result. This visual representation helps understand the sequential nature of workflow automation.",

  // Slide 1: Title
  "Good morning everyone. Welcome to this session on Automation Workflows for Research Work. My name is Rajesh Dhiman. Today we will talk about simple computer helpers that can reduce the time you spend on reading, writing, formatting, and tracking research work. This session is practical and meant for your daily academic work, not industry or business use.",

  // Slide 2: Daily Research Problems
  "Let us start with problems you already face every day. Writing drafts takes a lot of time. Formatting equations is slow and frustrating. Rewriting text to avoid plagiarism creates stress. Tracking papers, deadlines, and funding calls is mostly manual. These problems are common across departments, and today we will see how simple tools can help.",

  // Slide 3: What Do We Mean by Automation
  "When I say automation, I do not mean complex systems. Think of it as a computer helper. This helper notices new information, follows a few rules, and repeats boring work for you. The goal is not to replace thinking, but to reduce effort so you can focus on research and teaching.",

  // Slide 4: How Researchers Already Use Automation
  "You are already using automation without calling it automation. Reference managers, spell checkers, citation tools, and equation editors are all helpers. Today we are only extending this idea. Instead of one tool doing one task, we connect multiple helpers together.",

  // Slide 5: Workflow Tools
  "Workflow tools help connect helpers together. Zapier is simple and good for basic tasks with very little setup. n8n gives more control and can run on university servers, which is important for privacy. Both allow you to design workflows visually, without heavy coding.",

  // Slide 6: Tools for Reading and Writing Papers
  "These tools help with reading and writing research papers. Consensus helps you find real papers. Scite shows how citations are used. Jenni helps expand drafts with references. Paperpal improves academic language. These tools support your work, but you remain the author.",

  // Slide 7: Use Case 1 Introduction
  "Now let us look at a real use case. Literature review is time-consuming. Many of us read dozens of abstracts daily. This example shows how a helper can reduce that effort while keeping you informed.",

  // Slide 8: Literature Review Workflow
  "Here is the workflow step by step. First, a new paper appears on a research website. Second, the system checks if it matches your keywords. Third, a short summary is created. Finally, the summary is stored and sent to you. You decide later whether to read the full paper.",

  // Slide 9: Safe Writing with Assistance
  "Many people worry about plagiarism. The safe approach is grounding, drafting, and polishing. First, collect facts from real papers. Second, expand your ideas with writing tools. Third, improve language. Always review and rewrite before submitting. The responsibility stays with you.",

  // Slide 10: Writing Mathematical Equations
  "For mathematics, these tools help with formatting, not thinking. You can convert text to LaTeX, clean equation structure, and explain formulas step by step. This saves time and reduces formatting errors.",

  // Slide 11: Tracking Opportunities
  "Funding and deadlines are critical. Instead of checking many websites manually, a helper can visit them regularly, extract key details, and send you a summary. This reduces the risk of missing important opportunities.",

  // Slide 12: Asking Questions to Your Data
  "Instead of complex formulas, you can ask questions in simple English. Upload your data, ask a clear question, and get charts or summaries. This is helpful for quick analysis and early exploration of data.",

  // Slide 13: Asking Clear Questions
  "Clear instructions give better results. Vague requests create confusion. When you give structure, length, and style, the output improves. This is useful not only for tools, but also for student instructions and assignments.",

  // Slide 14: Responsible Use
  "These tools are helpers, not decision makers. Always check facts. Review all outputs. Follow journal and university guidelines. Do not upload sensitive or private data. Responsible use is essential in academic environments.",

  // Slide 15: Manual vs Assisted Workflow
  "This table compares manual and assisted work. The goal is not speed alone, but accuracy and reduced mental load. Assisted workflows help you reach the same academic standards with less repetitive effort.",

  // Slide 16: What Changes for Researchers
  "With helpers, administrative work reduces, publishing becomes faster, and citation accuracy improves. The quality of thinking does not change, but the effort around it reduces.",

  // Slide 17: Hands-on Session
  "Next, we will move to a hands-on session. We will build a simple workflow together using visual tools. No coding is required. The goal is to show that these ideas are practical and usable in your daily academic work.",
